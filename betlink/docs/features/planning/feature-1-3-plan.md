# Feature 1.3: Role-Based Placeholder Pages - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Feature Goal
Create role-based placeholder pages and navigation system that provides different experiences based on user roles (Master, Admin, Tipster, Cliente), following the Incremental Visibility Principle.

## 📊 Success Metrics
- ✅ Three role-based pages accessible at: `/admin`, `/dashboard`, `/meus-canais`
- ✅ Navigation menu visible on homepage with links to appropriate pages
- ✅ Different placeholder content displayed based on user role
- ✅ Clean, responsive design using existing UI components
- ✅ All pages load without errors
- ✅ Visible at localhost:3000 immediately after implementation

## 🧪 Human Test Requirements
1. **Navigation Test**:
   - Visit homepage at localhost:3000
   - See navigation menu with all three role pages
   - Click each link and verify page loads

2. **Page Content Test**:
   - Visit `/admin` - see Master/Admin placeholder content
   - Visit `/dashboard` - see Cliente placeholder content  
   - Visit `/meus-canais` - see Tipster placeholder content

3. **Design Consistency Test**:
   - All pages use same design system as homepage
   - Role badges maintain color consistency
   - Mobile responsive layout works

4. **Error Handling Test**:
   - No console errors on any page
   - No broken links or navigation issues

## 🔗 Dependencies & Constraints

### Dependencies:
- ✅ Feature 1.1: Next.js setup complete
- ✅ Feature 1.2: Supabase connection with real user data
- ✅ shadcn/ui components configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS working

### Constraints:
- No authentication system yet (coming in Feature 1.4)
- Pages should be simple placeholders
- Must use existing design patterns and components
- Cannot modify core layout or database connection

### Available Resources:
- 4 test users in database with different roles
- Established role color system (Purple=Master, Red=Admin, Blue=Tipster, Green=Cliente)
- Working Badge and Card components
- Server Component pattern for data fetching

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### 1. Page Structure
```
app/
├── admin/
│   └── page.tsx       # Admin dashboard placeholder
├── dashboard/
│   └── page.tsx       # Cliente dashboard placeholder
├── meus-canais/
│   └── page.tsx       # Tipster channels placeholder
└── page.tsx           # Homepage (add navigation)
```

### 2. Navigation Component
- Create a simple header component with navigation links
- Display all role pages (no auth protection yet)
- Use consistent styling with existing components

### 3. Page Content Strategy
Each page will display:
- Page title indicating the role
- Role-specific welcome message
- Placeholder cards showing future features
- Consistent design using existing components

### 4. Implementation Order
1. Create the three page directories and basic pages
2. Add navigation component to homepage
3. Style each page with role-appropriate content
4. Test all navigation paths

## ⏱️ Time Estimates
- **Planning & Setup**: 30 minutes ✅ (this document)
- **Page Creation**: 45 minutes
- **Navigation Component**: 30 minutes
- **Styling & Polish**: 30 minutes
- **Testing & Documentation**: 45 minutes
- **Total Estimate**: ~3 hours

## 🎯 Incremental Visibility Checkpoints
1. **After Page Creation** (45 min): Visit /admin, /dashboard, /meus-canais to see basic pages
2. **After Navigation** (1h 15min): Homepage shows navigation menu with working links
3. **After Styling** (1h 45min): All pages have role-appropriate design
4. **After Testing** (2h 30min): Everything works smoothly

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Page Structure
- Create `app/admin/page.tsx`
- Create `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Create `app/meus-canais/page.tsx`
- Each with basic "Hello [Role]" content

### Step 2: Add Navigation
- Create navigation component
- Add to homepage
- Include links to all three pages

### Step 3: Enhance Page Content
- Add role-specific placeholder content
- Use Card components for future features
- Apply role color badges

### Step 4: Test & Polish
- Test all navigation paths
- Ensure responsive design
- Check for console errors

## 📋 Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [x] Read Feature 1.2 handover document
- [x] Understand project structure
- [x] Review available components
- [x] Plan page layouts
- [ ] Create progress tracking document
- [ ] Update project master plan

## 🔍 Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Not needed for static pages
2. **Integration Testing**: Playwright tests for navigation
3. **Manual Testing**: Click through all pages
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure homepage still displays users

## 📝 Notes
- This feature sets up the routing foundation for the entire application
- Keep pages simple - they're placeholders for future features
- Focus on clean navigation and consistent design
- No database operations needed for this feature
- Prepare foundation for authentication in Feature 1.4
