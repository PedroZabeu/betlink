# Handover to Feature 1.5: Middleware + RLS for Users

## 📋 From Feature 1.4 to 1.5

**Date**: 2025-07-23
**From**: Feature 1.4 (Basic Authentication) ✅
**To**: Feature 1.5 (Middleware + RLS)
**Status**: Ready to start

## ✅ What Feature 1.4 Delivered

### Complete Authentication System
1. **Working Login**:
   - All 4 test users can login successfully
   - Password: `123456`
   - Role-based redirects working

2. **Session Management**:
   - Sessions persist across page refreshes
   - Cookies properly set with httpOnly
   - Auth state available throughout app

3. **Security Features**:
   - Rate limiting (5 attempts / 15 minutes)
   - Account lockout functionality
   - Password verification via database function

4. **UI Components**:
   - Navigation shows logged-in user
   - Role badge displays correctly
   - Logout functionality working

## 🎯 What Feature 1.5 Needs to Build

### 1. Middleware Protection
Create `middleware.ts` to:
- Protect `/admin` routes (Master/Admin only)
- Protect `/meus-canais` (Tipster only)
- Protect `/dashboard` (Cliente only)
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)
Enable RLS on profiles table:
- Users can only read their own profile
- Only service role can update profiles
- Proper policies for each operation

### 3. Enhanced Auth Flow
- Add "Remember Me" functionality
- Implement proper session refresh
- Add auth state to server components

## 🔧 Technical Context

### Current Auth Implementation
```typescript
// AuthProvider provides:
const { user, profile, loading, signIn, signOut } = useAuth()

// Server actions available:
import { signIn, signOut, getCurrentUser } from '@/app/actions/auth'
```

### Database State
- RLS currently DISABLED on profiles table
- Auth users linked via user_id column
- Service role key available in env

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... # Added in 1.4
```

## 💡 Implementation Suggestions

### 1. Middleware Strategy
```typescript
// middleware.ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Get session from cookies
  // Check user role from profile
  // Protect routes based on role
  // Redirect if unauthorized
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*', '/meus-canais/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*']
}
```

### 2. RLS Policy Examples
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Service role can do everything
CREATE POLICY "Service role has full access" ON profiles
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt()->>'role' = 'service_role');
```

### 3. Testing Approach
1. Enable RLS policies one by one
2. Test each user role separately
3. Verify unauthorized access is blocked
4. Check that service operations still work

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. Don't Break Existing Auth
- Test login still works after enabling RLS
- Ensure profile queries include user_id filter
- Keep service role operations separate

### 2. Gradual RLS Rollout
- Start with SELECT policies
- Add INSERT/UPDATE policies carefully
- Test extensively before each policy

### 3. Middleware Performance
- Cache auth checks where possible
- Minimize database queries
- Use edge runtime if available

## 📊 Success Criteria

Feature 1.5 is complete when:
1. [ ] Unauthorized users cannot access protected routes
2. [ ] Each role can only access their allowed pages
3. [ ] RLS prevents users from seeing other profiles
4. [ ] Login/logout still works perfectly
5. [ ] No performance degradation

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

1. **Access Control**:
   - Cliente tries to access /admin → redirected
   - Logged out user tries /dashboard → redirected to login
   - Admin can access /admin successfully

2. **RLS Protection**:
   - User A cannot read User B's profile
   - User can read their own profile
   - Service role can read all profiles

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Session expires during navigation
   - Multiple tabs with different sessions
   - Direct URL access to protected routes

2. **Supabase RLS Guide**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security
3. **Current Auth Implementation**: See Feature 1.4 files

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Create `/betlink/betlink/middleware.ts`
2. Implement basic route protection
3. Test with all 4 user roles
4. Enable RLS on profiles table
5. Add policies incrementally
6. Update documentation
