# Master Plan Revision - July 23, 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the major revisions made to the BetLink project master plan to improve incremental delivery and project manageability.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Unified Authentication Approach ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: Keep the current unified login implementation
- **Rationale**: The single LoginForm component with role detection is cleaner and more maintainable than separate login pages
- **Impact**: Removes requirement for separate `/admin/login` page

### 2. Email Infrastructure Deferral üìÖ
- **Decision**: Move all email functionality to new EPIC 7
- **Rationale**: Email requires significant infrastructure (SMTP, templates, queuing)
- **Impact**: Faster MVP delivery, can use mock notifications in early EPICs

### 3. Feature Scope Reduction üéØ
- **Decision**: Split large features into smaller, testable pieces
- **Changes**:
  - Feature 1.6: Now only creates the request form UI
  - Feature 1.7: Split into three features (registration, password reset, admin view)
- **Rationale**: Each feature now delivers visible functionality at localhost:3000

### 4. Complex Workflow Deferral ‚è≥
- **Decision**: Move complex workflows to appropriate EPICs
- **Moved Items**:
  - Tipster creation by admin ‚Üí EPIC 4
  - Email notifications ‚Üí EPIC 7
  - Telegram validation ‚Üí EPIC 6
  - Advanced session management ‚Üí EPIC 7
- **Rationale**: Keeps EPIC 1 focused on core authentication

## EPIC 1 Changes

### Before (7 features):
1. Initial Setup
2. Supabase Connection
3. Role-Based Pages
4. Basic Authentication
5. Middleware + RLS
6. Expand Schema + Channel Requests (large)
7. Complete Auth Flow (very large)

### After (9 features):
1. Initial Setup ‚úÖ
2. Supabase Connection ‚úÖ
3. Role-Based Pages ‚úÖ
4. Basic Authentication ‚úÖ
5. Middleware + RLS + Navigation UI
6. Channel Request Form (UI only)
7. Client Registration
8. Password Reset
9. Admin Request View

## New EPIC 7: Communications & Notifications

### Features:
1. Email Infrastructure
2. Notification System
3. Advanced Session Management

### Dependencies:
- EPIC 1 (for auth foundation)
- EPIC 4 (for user management)

## Benefits of Revision

1. **Incremental Visibility**: Every feature shows progress at localhost:3000
2. **Reduced Complexity**: EPIC 1 is now more achievable in 4 days
3. **Better Testing**: Smaller features are easier to test thoroughly
4. **Clearer Dependencies**: Complex features grouped in appropriate EPICs
5. **Faster MVP**: Can deliver core functionality without email infrastructure

## Impact on Timeline

- **EPIC 1**: Extended by 1 day (now 4 days instead of 3)
- **Overall Project**: No significant impact - work redistributed, not added
- **MVP**: Can be delivered faster (EPICs 1-3 without email)

## Next Steps

1. Implement Feature 1.5 with navigation bar and avatar
2. Continue with smaller, incremental features
3. Use mock notifications until EPIC 7
4. Focus on visible progress with each feature
