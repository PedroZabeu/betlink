## 🎯 Development Protocol Updates

### Cursor IDE Integration (Updated: July 22, 2025)
**IMPORTANT**: New protocol for Supabase database operations.

**When database operations are needed:**
1. **Claude Code creates**: `docs/cursor-instructions/[feature-name]-database-ops.md`
2. **Document contains**: Exact Cursor IDE commands with @supabase prompts
3. **Human executes**: Database operations via Cursor IDE
4. **Feature continues**: After database operations complete

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reliable database operations via proven Cursor MCP
- ✅ Version controlled database instructions
- ✅ No sensitive tokens in Claude Code environment
- ✅ Faster development cycle

**Example Workflow**:
```
Claude Code: Creates feature-1-3-database-ops.md
Human: Executes @supabase commands in Cursor
Claude Code: Continues feature development
```
