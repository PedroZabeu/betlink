- **EPIC Completion**: Full user journey testing from registration to dashboard access

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Supabase RLS complexity | High | Medium | Start with simple policies, use context7 MCP for examples |
| Next.js middleware auth conflicts | High | Low | Follow Next.js 15 auth patterns, test incrementally |
| User role confusion in UI | Medium | Medium | Clear visual indicators, consistent navigation patterns |
| Session persistence issues | Medium | Low | Use Supabase SSR package correctly |
| Complex auth flows breaking | High | Medium | Implement features incrementally, test each flow |
| Mock data not realistic enough | Low | Medium | Create representative user profiles matching real use cases |

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Features 1.1-1.2) 
**Goal**: Working tech stack with database connectivity
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Key Milestone**: Dynamic data display from Supabase
- **Success Metric**: Homepage shows mock users from database

### Phase 2: Navigation & Basic Auth (Features 1.3-1.4)
**Goal**: User can login and navigate to role-appropriate pages
- **Duration**: 4-5 hours  
- **Key Milestone**: Login working with role-based redirects
- **Success Metric**: Each user type reaches their intended dashboard

### Phase 3: Security & Advanced Auth (Features 1.5-1.7)
**Goal**: Complete secure authentication system
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Key Milestone**: Full auth flows with proper security
- **Success Metric**: All authentication workflows function correctly

## Total Estimate
- **Features**: 7
- **Estimated time**: 12-16 hours (over 2-3 days)
- **Complexity**: Medium-High (authentication complexity)
- **Risk Level**: Medium (well-established patterns, but auth is always complex)

## Checkpoints & Validation

### Checkpoint 1: After Phase 1 (Features 1.1-1.2)
**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Is the infrastructure supporting planned features adequately?
- [ ] Do we need additional mock data for testing?
- [ ] Are there any dependencies we didn't anticipate?
- [ ] Is the feature list still accurate for the remaining phases?

**Decision Point**: Continue as planned / Adjust remaining features

### Checkpoint 2: After Phase 2 (Features 1.3-1.4)  
**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Is the authentication flow intuitive for users?
- [ ] Are role-based redirects working as expected?
- [ ] Do we need to modify any UI patterns established?
- [ ] Are there integration issues with Supabase Auth?

**Decision Point**: Continue as planned / Refine auth UX

### Checkpoint 3: EPIC Completion (After Feature 1.7)
**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] Are all authentication flows working end-to-end?
- [ ] Is the security implementation adequate for production?
- [ ] Are all user roles properly supported?
- [ ] Is documentation complete for handover to EPIC 2?

**Decision Point**: EPIC complete / Additional refinement needed
